      "md": "\n# CORE CONCEPTS (PG 5-9)\n\nAn introduction to the essential rules terms and concepts that underpin every Warhammer 40,000 battle.\n\n# DETERMINING VISIBILITY\n\nWarhammer 40,000 uses true line of sight to determine visibility between models. To check this, get a ‘model’s perspective’ view by looking from behind the observing model. For the purposes of determining visibility, an observing model can see through other models in its unit, and a model’s base is also part of that model.\n\n# MODEL VISIBLE\n\nIf any part of another model can be seen from any part of the observing model, that other model is visible to the observing model.\n\n# UNIT VISIBLE\n\nIf one or more models in a unit is visible to the observing model, then that model’s unit is visible to the observing model.\n\n# MODEL FULLY VISIBLE\n\nIf every part of another model that is facing the observing model can be seen from any part of the observing model, then that other model is said to be fully visible to the observing model, i.e. the observing model has line of sight to all parts of the other model that are facing it, without any other models or terrain features blocking visibility to any of those parts.\n\n# ENGAGEMENT RANGE\n\nEngagement Range represents the zone of threat that models present to their enemies. While a model is within 1\" horizontally and 5\" vertically of an enemy model, those models – and units – are within Engagement Range of each other.\n\n# ARMIES\n\nEach player in a game of Warhammer 40,000 commands an army of Citadel miniatures, hereafter referred to as models. The mission you have selected will guide you as to how big your army should be.\n\n# HINTS AND TIPS\n\nSome pages feature Hints and Tips, covering topics like dice-rolling practices and how to ensure you don’t damage your models while moving them around the battlefield. You can find out more about missions on pages 57-58.\n\n# STRATEGIC RESERVES AND STRATAGEMS\n\nFrom well-timed Strategic Reserves to deftly executed Stratagems, gifted generals make use of all the tactical advantages at their disposal.\n\n# UNIT FULLY VISIBLE\n\nIf every model in a unit is fully visible to an observing model, then that unit is fully visible to that observing model. For the purposes of determining if an enemy unit is fully visible, an observing model can see through other models in the unit it is observing.\n\n# TERRAIN FEATURES\n\nThe scenery on a battlefield can be represented by models from the Warhammer 40,000 range. These models are called terrain features to differentiate them from the models that make up your army. Terrain features are set up on the battlefield before battle begins. You can find out more about terrain features on pages 44-48.\n\n# MEASURING DISTANCES\n\nDistances in Warhammer 40,000 are measured in inches. You can measure distances whenever you wish. When measuring the distance between models, measure between the closest points of the bases of the models you are measuring to and from. If a model does not have a base, measure to the closest point of any part of that model in question.\n\n# MUSTER YOUR ARMY\n\nUse these steps before battle to organise your warriors and war machines into a formidable fighting force.\n\n# MISSIONS\n\nBefore committing your forces to war, you must first establish your strategic goals and the nature of the battlefield to be fought over. This section presents the essential steps involved in preparing for any kind of Warhammer 40,000 battle.\n\n# PAGE NUMBERS\n\nThroughout the Core Rules you will find page numbers shown within stylised triangles. These function independently from any other page numbers within a publication; any page references found within the Core Rules – and any page references to the Core Rules found elsewhere – are based on this system, and do not relate to any other page numbers outside of the Core Rules.\n\n# CORE RULES | CORE CONCEPTS\n\nAll datasheets have a list of keywords, separated into Faction keywords and other keywords. Faction keywords can be used to help you decide which models to include in your army, but otherwise both sets of keywords are functionally the same.\n\n",

If either the Leader unit or the Bodyguard unit in an Attached unit is destroyed, the Starting Strength of the remaining unit is changed to be equal to its original Starting Strength.\n\nExample: A Primaris Captain (Starting Strength 1) is attached to a unit of Intercessors (Starting Strength 5). This Attached unit has a Starting Strength of 6. If all the Intercessors are destroyed, the remaining Primaris Captain would revert to having a Starting Strength of 1.\n\n# DESTROYED\n\nThroughout a battle, models will suffer damage and be destroyed. When a model is destroyed, it is removed from the battlefield. When every model in a unit has been destroyed, that unit is destroyed.\n\nFor the purposes of rules that are triggered when a unit is destroyed, such rules are still triggered when one of the individual units that made up an Attached unit is destroyed (the Leader or the Bodyguard unit).\n\nExample: If a rule awards you with 1VP each time an enemy unit is destroyed, and you target an Attached unit, you would gain 1VP if the Bodyguard unit is destroyed and 1VP if the Leader unit is destroyed (for a total of 2VP).\n\n",

      "md": "# 5. INFLICT DAMAGE\n\nThe damage inflicted is equal to the Damage (D) characteristic of the attack. A model loses one wound for each point of damage it suffers. If a model’s wounds are reduced to 0 or less, it is destroyed and removed from play. If a model loses several wounds from an attack and is destroyed, any excess damage inflicted by that attack is lost and has no effect.\n\n# MORTAL WOUNDS\n\nSome attacks are so powerful that no armour or force field can withstand their fury.\n\nSome attacks inflict mortal wounds. Each mortal wound inflicts one point of damage on the target unit, and they are always applied one at a time. Do not make a Wound roll or saving throw (including invulnerable saving throws) against a mortal wound – just allocate it as you would any other attack and inflict damage to a model in the target unit as described on the right.\n\nUnlike damage inflicted by normal attacks, excess damage from mortal wounds is not lost if the damage can be allocated to another model. Instead, keep allocating damage to another model in the target unit until either all the damage has been allocated or the target unit is destroyed.\n\nIf, when a unit is selected to shoot or fight, one or more of its attacks can inflict mortal wounds on the target, resolve any normal damage inflicted by the attacking unit’s attacks on that target before inflicting any mortal wounds on that target. If an attack inflicts mortal wounds in addition to any normal damage, but the normal damage is subsequently saved, the target unit still suffers those mortal wounds, as described above.\n\n- Each mortal wound inflicted on a unit causes one model in that unit to lose one wound.\n- No saving throws can be made against mortal wounds.\n- Mortal wounds inflicted by attacks always apply after any normal damage, even if that damage was saved.\n\n# FEEL NO PAIN\n\nSome warriors refuse to be laid low, even by what should be fatal wounds.\n\nSome models have ‘Feel No Pain x+’ listed in their abilities. Each time a model with this ability suffers damage and so would lose a wound (including wounds lost due to mortal wounds), roll one D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the number denoted by ‘x’, that wound is ignored and is not lost. If a model has more than one Feel No Pain ability, you can only use one of those abilities each time that model suffers damage and so would lose a wound.\n\nFeel No Pain x+: Each time this model would lose a wound, roll one D6: if the result equals or exceeds ‘x’, that wound is not lost.\n\n# DEADLY DEMISE\n\nFrom detonating ammo stores to corrosive innards or frenzied death throes, some targets are deadly even in defeat.\n\nSome models have ‘Deadly Demise x’ listed in their abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a TRANSPORT, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit within 6\" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by ‘x’ (if this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6\").\n\nExample: A TRANSPORT model with the Deadly Demise D3 ability is destroyed. Before any models disembark and before removing it from play, its controlling player rolls one D6, getting a 6. There are three units within 6\" of that destroyed model, so its controlling player rolls one D3 for each of them, inflicting mortal wounds accordingly.\n\n- Deadly Demise x: When this model is destroyed, roll one D6. On a 6, each unit within 6\" suffers ‘x’ mortal wounds.\n\n# CORE RULES | MAKING ATTACKS",

If the results of those D3s were 1, then 2, then 3, the attacks would result in a total of two destroyed models, but applying them in the order 3, then 2, then 1 would result in two models being destroyed and a third being damaged with only one wound remaining. As such, the rolls should be made one at a time.\n4. The attacks all have an Armour Penetration characteristic of -1, so in this instance, even though the Terminators have an invulnerable saving throw, their normal Save characteristic will afford them a better chance of survival. The saving throws rolled result in a 1, 2, 4, 5 and 5, meaning that two are failed.\n5. The Space Marines player now has to allocate those two attacks, one at a time. One Terminator model has already lost two wounds earlier in the battle, so they must allocate attacks to that model first. This means that that model loses its last remaining wound (Terminator models have a Wounds characteristic of 3), and is destroyed. The last attack is allocated to a different model, and so that model suffers one wound.",

Often these are unique to those weapons and are written out in full, but others are common to many weapons, and may only be referenced by name on a weapon’s profile. Some notable examples of these common abilities are defined here; further weapon abilities may be found in other locations such as Codexes.\n\n# ASSAULT\n\nAssault weapons fire so indiscriminately that they can be shot from the hip as warriors dash forward. Weapons with [ASSAULT] in their profile are known as Assault weapons. If a unit that Advanced this turn contains any models equipped with Assault weapons, it is still eligible to shoot in this turn’s Shooting phase. When such a unit is selected to shoot, you can only resolve attacks using Assault weapons its models are equipped with.\n\n- Can be shot even if the bearer’s unit Advanced.\n\n# PISTOL\n\nPistols can be wielded even at point-blank range. Weapons with [PISTOL] in their profile are known as Pistols. If a unit contains any models equipped with Pistols, that unit is eligible to shoot in its controlling player’s Shooting phase even while it is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. When such a unit is selected to shoot, it can only resolve attacks using its Pistols and can only target one of the enemy units it is within Engagement Range of. In such circumstances, a Pistol can target an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit.\n\n- If a model is equipped with one or more Pistols, unless it is a MONSTER or VEHICLE model, it can either shoot with its Pistols or with all of its other ranged weapons. Declare whether such a model will shoot with its Pistols or its other ranged weapons before selecting targets.\n- Can be shot even if the bearer’s unit is within Engagement Range of enemy units, but must target one of those enemy units.\n- Cannot be shot alongside any other non-Pistol weapon (except by a MONSTER or VEHICLE).\n\n# RAPID FIRE\n\nRapid fire weapons are capable of long-ranged precision shots or controlled bursts at nearby targets. Weapons with [RAPID FIRE X] in their profile are known as Rapid Fire weapons. Each time such a weapon targets a unit within half that weapon’s range, the Attacks characteristic of that weapon is increased by the amount denoted by ‘x’.\n\nExample: A model targets a unit that is within half range of a weapon with an Attacks characteristic of 1 and the [RAPID FIRE 1] ability. That weapon therefore makes two attacks at the target, and you make two Hit rolls.\n\n- [RAPID FIRE X]: Increase the Attacks by ‘x’ when targeting units within half range.\n\n# TORRENT\n\nTorrent weapons shoot clouds of fire, gas or other lethal substances that few foes can hope to evade. Weapons with [TORRENT] in their profile are known as Torrent weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, that attack automatically hits the target.\n\n# IGNORES COVER\n\nSome weapons are designed to root enemy formations out of entrenched positions. Weapons with [IGNORES COVER] in their profile are known as Ignores Cover weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, the target cannot have the Benefit of Cover against that attack (pg 44).\n\n# LETHAL HITS\n\nSome weapons can inflict fatal injuries on any foe, no matter their resilience. Weapons with [LETHAL HITS] in their profile are known as Lethal Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical Hit automatically wounds the target.\n\n# TWIN-LINKED\n\nDual weapons are often grafted to the same targeting system for greater lethality. Weapons with [TWIN-LINKED] in their profile are known as Twin-linked weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, you can re-roll that attack’s Wound roll.\n\n# LANCE\n\nLance weapons are deadly on the charge. Weapons with [LANCE] in their profile are known as Lance weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if the bearer made a Charge move this turn, add 1 to that attack’s Wound roll.\n\n# CORE RULES | WEAPON ABILITIES\n\n",

A unit is eligible to charge if it is within 12\" of one or more enemy units at the start of your Charge phase, unless any of the following apply:\n\n- That unit Advanced or Fell Back this turn.\n- That unit is within Engagement Range of any enemy models.\n- That unit is an AIRCRAFT unit.\n\nSELECT TARGETS\n3. Once you have selected an eligible unit to declare a charge, you must select one or more enemy units within 12\" of it as the targets of that charge. The targets of a charge do not need to be visible to the charging unit.\n\nMAKE CHARGE ROLL\n4. You then make a Charge roll for the charging unit by rolling 2D6.

If any of these conditions cannot be met, the charge fails and no models in the charging unit move this phase. Otherwise, the charge is successful and the models in the charging unit make a Charge move – move each model a distance in inches up to the result of the Charge roll. When doing so, each model in the charging unit must end its Charge move closer to one of the units selected as a target of its charge. If you can also move a charging model so that it ends its Charge move in base-to-base contact with one or more enemy models while still enabling the charging unit to end its move satisfying all of the conditions above, you must do so.

In either case, declare which attacks will target which units before any attacks are resolved.\n\nIf there are no eligible targets (because there are no enemy units within Engagement Range, for example) then that unit cannot make melee attacks this phase, but it can still Consolidate (pg 35).\n\n- Select targets for all attacks before any are resolved.\n- Attacking model must either be within Engagement Range of an enemy unit to target it, or in base-to-base contact with another model in its unit that is itself in base-to-base contact with that enemy unit.\n\n# MAKE ATTACKS\n\nMelee attacks follow the same attack sequence as ranged attacks (see Making Attacks, pages 21-23), and you make one Hit roll for each attack being made.\n\nIf more than one enemy unit has been targeted by an attacking unit’s melee attacks, resolve all of the attacks against one target before moving onto the next.\n\nIf your unit is making attacks with more than one melee weapon against a unit, and those weapons have different profiles, then after you have resolved an attack with one of those weapons, if any other weapons with the same profile are also being used to make attacks against that unit, you must resolve those attacks before resolving any other attacks against the target.\n\nNote that all of the attacks you have declared targets for are always resolved against the target units, even if, when you come to resolve an attack, no models in the target unit of that attack.\n\n",

Weapons with a range of ‘Melee’ are melee weapons and can only be used in close combat. All other weapons are ranged weapons.\n\n# LEADERSHIP TESTS\n\nIf a rule requires you to take a Leadership test for a unit, roll 2D6: if the total is greater than or equal to the best Leadership characteristic in that unit, that test is passed. Otherwise, it is failed.\n\n# RANDOM CHARACTERISTICS\n\nSome characteristics are a random value instead of a number. For example, a model’s Move characteristic might be 2D6\", or a weapon’s Attacks characteristic might be D6. When a unit with a random Move characteristic is selected to move, determine the entire unit’s move distance by rolling the indicated number of dice. For all other characteristics, roll to determine the value on an individual, per-model or per-weapon basis each time that characteristic is required.\n\n# AURA ABILITIES\n\nSome abilities affect multiple models or units in a given range. These are known as Aura abilities and are tagged with the word ‘Aura’. A model with an Aura ability is always within range of its own Aura ability. A unit can be affected by more than one Aura ability at a time, but if a unit is within range of the same Aura ability more than once, that Aura ability only applies to that unit once.\n\n# 3 ABILITIES\n\nMany units have special abilities and rules that may apply during the game, from Core Rules shared by many units to bespoke Psychic abilities and invulnerable saves. These will be described here, along with any rules that apply when larger models such as vehicles have suffered sufficient damage.\n\nSome abilities are bestowed by items of wargear that models in a unit can be equipped with, and are known as Wargear abilities. These only apply while a model in the unit is equipped with the relevant item of wargear.\n\n# 6 UNIT COMPOSITION AND OTHER RULES\n\nThis section details the number and types of models in the unit, and the default weapons and wargear those models are equipped with. It may also describe other interactions, such as how units with the Leader ability can attach to other units, and passenger restrictions that may apply to TRANSPORT models.\n\n# PSYCHIC WEAPONS AND ABILITIES\n\nSome weapons and abilities can only be used by PSYKERS. Such weapons and abilities are tagged with the word ‘Psychic’. If a Psychic weapon or ability causes any unit to suffer one or more wounds, each of those wounds is considered to have been inflicted by a Psychic Attack.\n\n# 7 WARGEAR OPTIONS\n\nSome datasheets have a bullet-pointed list of wargear options. When you include such a unit in your army, you can use these options to change the weapons and other wargear of models in the unit. The order you use these options in does not matter, but each can only be used once.\n\n",

      "md": "# DEPLOYMENT ABILITIES\n\nSome abilities are used during deployment, or when setting a unit up – either on the battlefield or into Reserves. These are known as Deployment abilities, and some widespread examples of these are presented below.\n\n# DEEP STRIKE\n\nSome units make their way to battle via tunnelling, teleportation, high-altitude descent or other extraordinary means that allow them to appear suddenly in the thick of the fighting.\n\nDuring the Declare Battle Formations step, if every model in a unit has this ability, you can set it up in Reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9\" horizontally away from all enemy models.\n\n- Unit can be set up in Reserves instead of on the battlefield.\n- Unit can be set up in your Reinforcements step, more than 9\" horizontally away from all enemy models.\n\n# INFILTRATORS\n\nMany armies employ reconnaissance units who can sit concealed, waiting for the right moment to strike. During deployment, if every model in a unit has this ability, then when you set it up, it can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9\" horizontally away from the enemy deployment zone and all enemy models.\n\n# LEADER\n\nMighty heroes fight at the forefront of battle. Some CHARACTER units have ‘Leader’ listed on their datasheets. Such CHARACTER units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.\n\nDuring the Declare Battle Formations step, for each Leader in your army, if your army also includes one or more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.\n\nWhile a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic.\n\nEach time an attack successfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a CHARACTER model in that unit, even if that CHARACTER model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to CHARACTER models in that unit.\n\n- Before the battle, CHARACTER units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.\n- Attached units can only contain one Leader.\n- Attacks cannot be allocated to CHARACTER models in Attached units.\n\n# SCOUTS\n\nScouts form the vanguard of many armies. Unnoticed by the enemy, they range ahead of the main force. Some units have ‘Scouts x\"’ listed in their abilities. If every model in a unit has this ability, then at the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, it can make a Normal move of up to x\" as if it were your Movement phase – as can any DEDICATED TRANSPORT model such a unit starts the battle embarked within (provided only models with this ability are embarked within that DEDICATED TRANSPORT model).\n\nA unit that moves using this ability must end that move more than 9\" horizontally away from all enemy models. If both players have units that can do this, the player who is taking the first turn moves their units first.\n\nExample: A unit has the Scouts 6\" ability. At the start of the first battle round, the controlling player can make a Normal move with that unit of up to 6\".\n\n- Scouts x\": Unit can make a Normal move of up to x\" before the first turn begins.\n- If embarked in a DEDICATED TRANSPORT, that DEDICATED TRANSPORT can make this move instead.\n- Must end this move more than 9\" horizontally away from all enemy models.\n\n# CORE RULES | DEPLOYMENT ABILITIES",
